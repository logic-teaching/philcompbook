    "Recall that the number of symbols is assumed to be finite. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then for each $n$, there are only finitely many strings of symbols of length $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each $n$, let $f(n)$ be the maximum number of steps which machine $M$ takes to halt on inputs of length $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this function $f$ is *the running time complexity* of $M$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This running $f$ time is *polynomial* if there is a polynomial $p(n)$ and constant $n_0\\geq 0$ such that $f(n)\\leq c\\cdot p(n)$ for all $n\\geq n_0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the first term of a polynomial on the natural numbers eventually dominates the other terms, this is equivalent to there being constants $k>0, n_0\\geq 0, c>0$ such that $f(n)\\leq c\\cdot n^k$ for all $n\\geq n_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the Turing machine $M$ is itself said to be *polynomial-time* if its running time is polynomial."

If the input has length $n$, it has to sweep $n$-many times and each sweep takes $2n$-steps, counting both back and forth. Then it has running time $2n\\cdot n = 2n^2$.\n",

This has running time $\\sum_{i=1}^n (2(2^i)^2+(n-i))=1/6 (3 n^2 - 3 n + 4^{n + 2} - 16)$."
