               antecedent. Counterpossibles present a puzzle for standard
               theories of counterfactuals, which predict that all
               counterpossibles are semantically vacuous. Moreover,
               counterpossibles play an important role in many debates within
               metaphysics and epistemology, including debates over grounding,
               causation, modality, mathematics, science, and even God. In this
               article, we will explore various positions on counterpossibles
               as well as their potential philosophical consequences.},

@article{Jenny2018-xh,
	abstract = {I develop a theory of counterfactuals about relative
               computability, i.e. counterfactuals such as If the validity
               problem were algorithmically decidable, then the halting problem
               would also be algorithmically decidable, which is true, and If
               the validity problem were algorithmically decidable, then
               arithmetical truth would also be algorithmically decidable,
               which is false. These counterfactuals are counterpossibles, i.e.
               they have metaphysically impossible antecedents. They thus pose
               a challenge to the orthodoxy about counterfactuals, which would
               treat them as uniformly true. What's more, I argue that these
               counterpossibles don't just appear in the periphery of relative
               computability theory but instead they play an ineliminable role
               in the development of the theory. Finally, I present and discuss
               a model theory for these counterfactuals that is a
               straightforward extension of the familiar comparative similarity
               models.},

               unsolvability, i.e., a quantity which measures the amount of
               algorithmic unsolvability which is inherent in $$P$$P. We focus
               on two degree structures: the semilattice of Turing degrees,
               $$\textbackslashmathcal \{D\}_\textbackslashmathrm \{T\}$$DT,
               and its completion, $$\textbackslashmathcal

               Muchnik degrees. We emphasize specific, natural degrees and
               their relationship to reverse mathematics. We show how Muchnik
               degrees can be used to classify tiling problems and symbolic
               dynamical systems of finite type. We describe how the category
               of sheaves over $$\textbackslashmathcal

               intuitionistic mathematics, known as the Muchnik topos. This
               model is a rigorous implementation of Kolmogorov's nonrigorous
               1932 interpretation of intuitionism as a ``calculus of

	abstract = {Humanity's most basic intellectual quest to decipher nature and
               master it has led to numerous efforts to build machines that
               simulate the world or communi cate with it [Bus70, Tur36, MP43,
               Sha48, vN56, Sha41, Rub89, NK91, Nyc92]. The computational power
               and dynamic behavior of such machines is a central question for
               mathematicians, computer scientists, and occasionally,
               physicists. Our interest is in computers called artificial
               neural networks. In their most general framework, neural
               networks consist of assemblies of simple processors, or
               ``neurons,'' each of which computes a scalar activation function
               of its input. This activation function is nonlinear, and is
               typically a monotonic function with bounded range, much like
               neural responses to input stimuli. The scalar value produced by
               a neuron affects other neurons, which then calculate a new
               scalar value of their own. This describes the dynamical behavior
               of parallel updates. Some of the signals originate from outside
               the network and act as inputs to the system, while other signals
               are communicated back to the environment and are thus used to
               encode the end result of the computation.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive introduction to type systems and programming
               languages.A type system is a syntactic method for automatically

               classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values
               they compute. The study of type systems---and of programming

               applications in software engineering, language design,
               high-performance compilers, and security.This text provides a
               comprehensive introduction both to type systems in computer
               science and to the basic theory of programming languages. The
               approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is
               motivated by programming examples and the more theoretical
               sections are driven by the needs of implementations. Each
               chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as
               well as a running implementation, available via the Web.

               mathematical techniques necessary for those who are beginning a
               study of the semantics and logics of programming languages.
               These techniques will allow students to invent, formalize, and
               justify rules with which to reason about a variety of
               programming languages. Although the treatment is elementary,
               several of the topics covered are drawn from recent research,
               including the vital area of concurency. The book contains many
               exercises ranging from simple to miniprojects.Starting with
               basic set theory, structural operational semantics is introduced
               as a way to define the meaning of programming languages along
               with associated proof techniques. Denotational and axiomatic
               semantics are illustrated on a simple language of
               while-programs, and fall proofs are given of the equivalence of
               the operational and denotational semantics and soundness and
               relative completeness of the axiomatic semantics. A proof of
               Godel's incompleteness theorem, which emphasizes the
               impossibility of achieving a fully complete axiomatic semantics,
               is included. It is supported by an appendix providing an
               introduction to the theory of computability based on
               while-programs. Following a presentation of domain theory, the
               semantics and methods of proof for several functional languages
               are treated. The simplest language is that of recursion
               equations with both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation.
               This work is extended to lan guages with higher and recursive
               types, including a treatment of the eager and lazy
               lambda-calculi. Throughout, the relationship between
               denotational and operational semantics is stressed, and the
               proofs of the correspondence between the operation and
               denotational semantics are provided. The treatment of recursive
               types - one of the more advanced parts of the book - relies on
               the use of information systems to represent domains. The book
               concludes with a chapter on parallel programming languages,
               accompanied by a discussion of methods for specifying and
               verifying nondeterministic and parallel programs.},

               concepts and logical structure of mathematics, with an eye to
               the unity of human knowledge. Almost all of the problems studied
               in this book are motivated by an overriding foundational
               question: What are the appropriate axioms for mathematics?
               Through a series of case studies, these axioms are examined to
               prove particular theorems in core mathematical areas such as
               algebra, analysis, and topology, focusing on the language of
               second-order arithmetic, the weakest language rich enough to
               express and develop the bulk of mathematics. In many cases, if a
               mathematical theorem is proved from appropriately weak set
               existence axioms, then the axioms will be logically equivalent
               to the theorem. Furthermore, only a few specific set existence
               axioms arise repeatedly in this context, which in turn
               correspond to classical foundational programs. This is the theme
               of reverse mathematics, which dominates the first half of the
               book. The second part focuses on models of these and other
               subsystems of second-order arithmetic. Additional results are

               recursion theory, in which the reader is only assumed to know
               the basics of classical recursion theory. The book is divided
               into four parts: hyperarithmetic sets, metarecursion,
               $\alpha$-recursion, and E-recursion. This text is essential
               reading for all researchers in the field.},

@book{Nies2012-rp,
	abstract = {The interplay between computability and randomness has been an
                 active area of research in recent years, reflected by ample
                 funding in the USA, numerous workshops, and publications on
                 the subject. The complexity and the randomness aspect of a set
                 of natural numbers are closely related. Traditionally,
                 computability theory is concerned with the complexity aspect.
                 However, computability theoretic tools can also be used to
                 introduce mathematical counterparts for the intuitive notion
                 of randomness of a set. Recent research shows that,
                 conversely, concepts and methods originating from randomness
                 enrich computability theory. The book covers topics such as
                 lowness and highness properties, Kolmogorov complexity,
                 betting strategies and higher computability. Both the basics
                 and recent research results are desribed, providing a very
                 readable introduction to the exciting interface of
                 computability and randomness for graduates and researchers in
                 computability theory, theoretical computer science, and
                 measure theory.},

                 logic, some of them never before available in English
                 translation, are here gathered together for the first time.
                 Modern logic, heralded by Leibniz, may be said to have been
                 initiated by Boole, De Morgan, and Jevons, but it was the
                 publication in 1879 of Gottlob Frege's Begriffsschrift that
                 opened a great epoch in the history of logic by presenting, in
                 full-fledged form, the propositional calculus and
                 quantification theory. Frege's book, translated in its
                 entirety, begins the present volume. The emergence of two new
                 fields, set theory and foundations of mathematics, on the
                 borders of logic, mathematics, and philosophy, is depicted by
                 the texts that follow. Peano and Dedekind illustrate the trend
                 that led to Principia Mathematica. Burali-Forti, Cantor,
                 Russell, Richard, and K{\"o}nig mark the appearance of the
                 modern paradoxes. Hilbert, Russell, and Zermelo show various
                 ways of overcoming these paradoxes and initiate, respectively,
                 proof theory, the theory of types, and axiomatic set theory.
                 Skolem generalizes L{\"o}wenheim's theorem, and heand Fraenkel
                 amend Zermelo's axiomatization of set theory, while von
                 Neumann offers a somewhat different system. The controversy
                 between Hubert and Brouwer during the twenties is presented in
                 papers of theirs and in others by Weyl, Bernays, Ackermann,
                 and Kolmogorov. The volume concludes with papers by Herbrand
                 and by G{\"o}del, including the latter's famous incompleteness
                 paper. Of the forty-five contributions here collected all but
                 five are presented in extenso. Those not originally written in
                 English have been translated with exemplary care and
                 exactness; the translators are themselves mathematical
                 logicians as well as skilled interpreters of sometimes obscure
                 texts. Each paper is introduced by a note that sets it in
                 perspective, explains its importance, and points out
                 difficulties in interpretation. Editorial comments and
                 footnotes are interpolated where needed, and an extensive
                 bibliography is included.},

                 the texts that follow. Peano and Dedekind illustrate the trend
                 that led to Principia Mathematica. Burali-Forti, Cantor,
                 Russell, Richard, and K{\"o}nig mark the appearance of the
                 modern paradoxes. Hilbert, Russell, and Zermelo show various
                 ways of overcoming these paradoxes and initiate, respectively,
                 proof theory, the theory of types, and axiomatic set theory.
                 Skolem generalizes L{\"o}wenheim's theorem, and heand Fraenkel
                 amend Zermelo's axiomatization of set theory, while von
                 Neumann offers a somewhat different system. The controversy
                 between Hubert and Brouwer during the twenties is presented in
                 papers of theirs and in others by Weyl, Bernays, Ackermann,
                 and Kolmogorov. The volume concludes with papers by Herbrand
                 and by G{\"o}del, including the latter's famous incompleteness
                 paper. Of the forty-five contributions here collected all but
                 five are presented in extenso. Those not originally written in
                 English have been translated with exemplary care and
                 exactness; the translators are themselves mathematical
                 logicians as well as skilled interpreters of sometimes obscure
                 texts. Each paper is introduced by a note that sets it in
                 perspective, explains its importance, and points out
                 difficulties in interpretation. Editorial comments and
                 footnotes are interpolated where needed, and an extensive
                 bibliography is included.},

@article{Simpson1988-vn,
	abstract = {In [5] and [21] we studied countable algebra in the context of
               ``reverse mathematics''. We considered set existence axioms
               formulated in the language of second order arithmetic. We showed
               that many well-known theorems about countable fields, countable
               rings, countable abelian groups, etc. are equivalent to the
               respective set existence axioms which are needed to prove
               them.One classical algebraic theorem which we did not consider
               in [5] and [21] is the Hilbert basis theorem. Let K be a field.
               For any natural number m, let K[x1,{\ldots},xm] be the ring of
               polynomials over K in m commuting indeterminates x1,{\ldots},xm. The
               Hilbert basis theorem asserts that for all K and m, every ideal
               in the ring K[x1,{\ldots},xm] is finitely generated. This theorem is of
               fundamental importance for invariant theory and for algebraic
               geometry. There is also a generalization, the Robson basis
               theorem [11], which makes a similar but more restrictive
               assertion about the ring K〈x1,{\ldots},xm〉 of polynomials over K in
               mnoncommuting indeterminates.In this paper we study a certain
               formal version of the Hilbert basis theorem within the language
               of second order arithmetic. Our main result is that, for any or
               all countable fields K, our version of the Hilbert basis theorem
               is equivalent to the assertion that the ordinal number
               $\omega$$\omega$ is well ordered. (The equivalence is provable
               in the weak base theory RCA0.) Thus the ordinal number
               $\omega$$\omega$ is a measure of the ``intrinsic logical
               strength'' of the Hilbert basis theorem. Such a measure is of
               interest in reference to the historic controversy surrounding
               the Hilbert basis theorem's apparent lack of constructive or
               computational content.},

                 problems. Computational complexity measures how much time or
                 memory is needed as a function of the input problem size.
                 Descriptive complexity is concerned with problems which may be
                 described in first-order logic. By virtue of the close

                 out that this subject has important applications to databases
                 such as analysing the queries computable in polynomial time,
                 analysing the parallel time needed to compute a query, and the
                 analysis of nondeterministic classes. This book is written as

               technical details, the author concentrates on discussing the
               main results of learning theory and their connections to
               fundamental problems in statistics. These include: * the setting
               of learning problems based on the model of minimizing the risk
               functional from empirical data * a comprehensive analysis of the
               empirical risk minimization principle including necessary and
               sufficient conditions for its consistency * non-asymptotic
               bounds for the risk achieved using the empirical risk
               minimization principle * principles for controlling the
               generalization ability of learning machines using small sample
               sizes based on these bounds * the Support Vector methods that
               control the generalization ability when estimating function
               using small sample size. The second edition of the book contains
               three new chapters devoted to further development of the
               learning theory and SVM techniques. These include: * the theory
               of direct method of learning based on solving multidimensional
               integral equations for density, conditional probability, and
               conditional density estimation * a new inductive principle of

                 logic, some of them never before available in English
                 translation, are here gathered together for the first time.
                 Modern logic, heralded by Leibniz, may be said to have been
                 initiated by Boole, De Morgan, and Jevons, but it was the
                 publication in 1879 of Gottlob Frege's Begriffsschrift that
                 opened a great epoch in the history of logic by presenting, in
                 full-fledged form, the propositional calculus and
                 quantification theory. Frege's book, translated in its
                 entirety, begins the present volume. The emergence of two new
                 fields, set theory and foundations of mathematics, on the
                 borders of logic, mathematics, and philosophy, is depicted by
                 the texts that follow. Peano and Dedekind illustrate the trend
                 that led to Principia Mathematica. Burali-Forti, Cantor,
                 Russell, Richard, and K{\"o}nig mark the appearance of the
                 modern paradoxes. Hilbert, Russell, and Zermelo show various
                 ways of overcoming these paradoxes and initiate, respectively,
                 proof theory, the theory of types, and axiomatic set theory.
                 Skolem generalizes L{\"o}wenheim's theorem, and heand Fraenkel
                 amend Zermelo's axiomatization of set theory, while von
                 Neumann offers a somewhat different system. The controversy
                 between Hubert and Brouwer during the twenties is presented in
                 papers of theirs and in others by Weyl, Bernays, Ackermann,
                 and Kolmogorov. The volume concludes with papers by Herbrand
                 and by G{\"o}del, including the latter's famous incompleteness
                 paper. Of the forty-five contributions here collected all but
                 five are presented in extenso. Those not originally written in
                 English have been translated with exemplary care and
                 exactness; the translators are themselves mathematical
                 logicians as well as skilled interpreters of sometimes obscure
                 texts. Each paper is introduced by a note that sets it in
                 perspective, explains its importance, and points out

               developments in statistical learning theory.In Reliable
               Reasoning, Gilbert Harman and Sanjeev Kulkarni---a philosopher
               and an engineer---argue that philosophy and cognitive science
               can benefit from statistical learning theory (SLT), the theory
               that lies behind recent advances in machine learning. The
               philosophical problem of induction, for example, is in part
               about the reliability of inductive reasoning, where the
               reliability of a method is measured by its statistically
               expected percentage of errors---a central topic in SLT.After
               discussing philosophical attempts to evade the problem of
               induction, Harman and Kulkarni provide an admirably clear
               account of the basic framework of SLT and its implications for
               inductive reasoning. They explain the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC)
               dimension of a set of hypotheses and distinguish two kinds of
               inductive reasoning. The authors discuss various topics in
               machine learning, including nearest-neighbor methods, neural
               networks, and support vector machines. Finally, they describe
               transductive reasoning and suggest possible new models of human
               reasoning suggested by developments in SLT.},

               joint endeavor from leading researchers in the fields of
               philosophy and electrical engineering, An Elementary
               Introduction to Statistical Learning Theory is a comprehensive
               and accessible primer on the rapidly evolving fields of
               statistical pattern recognition and statistical learning theory.
               Explaining these areas at a level and in a way that is not often
               found in other books on the topic, the authors present the basic
               theory behind contemporary machine learning and uniquely utilize
               its foundations as a framework for philosophical thinking about
               inductive inference. Promoting the fundamental goal of
               statistical learning, knowing what is achievable and what is
               not, this book demonstrates the value of a systematic
               methodology when used along with the needed techniques for
               evaluating the performance of a learning system. First, an
               introduction to machine learning is presented that includes
               brief discussions of applications such as image recognition,
               speech recognition, medical diagnostics, and statistical
               arbitrage. To enhance accessibility, two chapters on relevant
               aspects of probability theory are provided. Subsequent chapters
               feature coverage of topics such as the pattern recognition
               problem, optimal Bayes decision rule, the nearest neighbor rule,
               kernel rules, neural networks, support vector machines, and
               boosting. Appendices throughout the book explore the
               relationship between the discussed material and related topics
               from mathematics, philosophy, psychology, and statistics,
               drawing insightful connections between problems in these areas
               and statistical learning theory. All chapters conclude with a
               summary section, a set of practice questions, and a reference
               sections that supplies historical notes and additional resources
               for further study. An Elementary Introduction to Statistical
               Learning Theory is an excellent book for courses on statistical
               learning theory, pattern recognition, and machine learning at
               the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It also serves as
               an introductory reference for researchers and practitioners in
               the fields of engineering, computer science, philosophy, and
               cognitive science that would like to further their knowledge of
               the topic.},

               computation by a human being does not apply directly to
               mechanical devices. A set-theoretic form of description for
               discrete deterministic machines is elaborated and four
               principles (or constraints) are enunciated, which, it is argued,
               any such machine must satisfy. The most important of these,
               called ``the principle of local causality'' rejects the
               possibility of instantaneous action at a distance. Although the
               principles are justified by an appeal to the geometry of
               space-time, the formulation is quite abstract, and can be
               applied to all kinds of automata and to algebraic systems. It is
               proved that if a device satisfies the principles then its
               successive states form a computable sequence. Counter-examples
               are constructed which show that if the principles be weakened in
               almost any way, then there will be devices which satisfy the
               weakened principles and which can calculate any number-theoretic
               function.},

               knowledge, the sciences of the mind are now in a position to
               offer concrete, empirically validated answers to the most
               fundamental questions about human nature. What does it mean to
               be a mind? How is the mind related to the brain? How are minds
               shaped by their embodiment and environment? What are the
               principles behind cognitive functions such as perception,
               memory, language, thought, and consciousness?By analyzing the
               tasks facing any sentient being that is subject to stimulation
               and a pressure to act, Shimon Edelman identifies computation as
               the common denominator in the emerging answers to all these
               questions. Any system composed of elements that exchange signals
               with each other and occasionally with the rest of the world can
               be said to be engaged in computation. A brain composed of
               neurons is one example of a system that computes, and the
               computations that the neurons collectively carry out constitute
               the brain's mind.Edelman presents a computational account of the
               entire spectrum of cognitive phenomena that constitutes the
               mind. He begins with sentience, and uses examples from visual
               perception to demonstrate that it must, at its very core, be a
               type of computation. Throughout his account, Edelman
               acknowledges the human mind's biological origins. Along the way,
               he also demystifies traits such as creativity, language, and
               individual and collective consciousness, and hints at how
               naturally evolved minds can transcend some of their limitations
               by moving to computational substrates other than brains. The
               account that Edelman gives in this book is accessible, yet
               unified and rigorous, and the big picture he presents is
               supported by evidence ranging from neurobiology to computer
               science. The book should be read by anyone seeking a
               comprehensive and current introduction to cognitive psychology.},

               philosophical questions surrounding the use of deep artificial
               neural networks (``deep learning'') to achieve artificial
               intelligence. Specifically, it links recent breakthroughs to
               classic works in empiricist philosophy of mind. In recent
               assessments of deep learning's potential, scientists have cited
               historical figures from the philosophical debate between
               nativism and empiricism, which concerns the origins of abstract
               knowledge. These empiricists were faculty psychologists; that
               is, they argued that the extraction of abstract knowledge from
               experience involves the active engagement of psychological
               faculties such as perception, memory, imagination, attention,
               and empathy. This book explains how recent deep learning
               breakthroughs realized some of the most ambitious ideas about
               these faculties from philosophers such as Aristotle, Ibn Sina
               (Avicenna), John Locke, David Hume, William James, and Sophie de
               Grouchy. It illustrates the utility of this interdisciplinary
               connection by showing how it can provide benefits to both
               philosophy and computer science: computer scientists can
               continue to mine the history of philosophy for ideas and
               aspirational targets to hit, and philosophers can see how some
               of the historical empiricists' most ambitious speculations can
               now be realized in specific computational systems.},
