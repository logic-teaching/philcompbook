I grant I have put the first of these questions rather loosely; nevertheless, I think that the answer, ought to be: *yes*. It is the second, which asks for a justification of this answer which provides the challenge ({cite}`Cobham1965-jz` p. 24)\n",

But the [other gaps have] the opposite problem: [of being] serenely *in*sensitive to distinctions that we actually care about, such as between finding a solution and verifying it [...] ({cite}`Aaronson2013-ek` p. 270)"
