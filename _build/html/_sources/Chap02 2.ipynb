    "We continue our survey the precursors to the notion of computation in the 1920s. Hilbert was motiviated to define a notion of contentful arithmetic as part of his program for proving the consistency of higher mathematics (consistency in the wide sense, what is often called conservation). This notion of contentful arithmetic seems to involve constructing and deconstructing numerals consisered as symbols which are tokened in a quasi-perceptual manner. In Brouwer and Heyting, we find an alternative idea emerging from the debates in the foundations of mathematics: mathematical assertions involve a primitive notion of construction, which involves the ability to act on other constructions.
