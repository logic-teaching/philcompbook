    "Our main topic in this course is computability. But we will have occasion here and there to talk about a couple of non-computable sets. Today we do a survey of non-computability. Even if you only care about what is computable, knowing what is on the other side can help you get a sense of the terrain, and can help you understand what might be at stake in deciding whether something is computable. The examples all require a bit of 'local knowledge.' Hence, not all of the examples will make sense to everyone, at least on the first pass. This chapter will succeed if it can give everyone of an example or two of a non-computable set whose topic is something that they are already diposed to care about. "
