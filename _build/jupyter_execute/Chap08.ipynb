    "### The implications of the first disjunct for intuitionism à la Heyting\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1931 conference, Browuer's student Heyting opened his contribution this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The intuitionist mathematician proposes to do mathematics as a natural function of his intellect, as a free, vital activity of thought. For him, mathematics is a production of the human mind. He uses language, both natural and formalized, only for communicating thoughts, i.e. to get others or himself to follow his own mathematical ideas. Such a lingusitics accompaniment is not a representation of mathematics; still less is it mathematics itself ({cite}`Heyting1931aa` p. 106, {cite}`Benacerraf1983aa p. 52).\n",
    "\n",
    "This of course echos what we heard from Brouwer himself in Chapter 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what Gödel says about the second disjunct:\n",
    "\n",
    "> On the other hand, the second alternative, where there exist absolutely undecidable mathematical propositions, seems to disprove the view that mathematics is only our creation; for the creator necesssarily knows all properties of his creatures, because they can't have any others except those he has given to them ({cite}`Godel1995-bg` p. 311).\n",
    "\n",
    "> As far as the second alternative is concenred, one might object that the  constructor need not necessarily know *every* property of what he constructs. For example, we build machines and still cannot predict their behaviour in every detail. But this objection is very poor. For we don't create the machines out of nothing, but built them out of some given material. If the situation were similar in mathematics, then this material or basis for our constructions would be something and would force some realistic viewpoint upon us even if certain other ingredients of mathematics were of our own creation ({cite}`Godel1995-bg` p. 312).\n",
    "\n",
    "This passage deserves careful reconstruction, but perhaps as a first attempt we can suggest that the argument goes something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take whatever \"material basis\" the intuitionist is willing to grant, like constructions or proofs or the like. Collect together everything we can assert about them into a theory $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The intuitionist will be forced into the second disjunct, and so there will be claims $\\varphi$ about their constructions and proofs such that they cannot assert $\\varphi$ and they cannot assert $\\neg \\varphi$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Brouwer and his followers (think back to the $\\pi$ example), were happy to banish such epistemically undecidable sentences out of the realm of the mathematically meaningful. But since $\\varphi$ pertains to their own view about constructions and proofs, this seems implausible. "

    "### Implications for logicism à la Carnap\n",
    "\n",
    "At the 1931 conference, Carnap wrote the exposition and defense of the logicist view. He closes by saying:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Logicism as here described has several features in common both with intuitionism and with formalism. It shares with intuitionism a constructivistic tendency with respect to definition, a tendency which Frege also emphatically endorsed. A concept may not be introduced axiomatically but must be constructed from undefined, primitive concepts step by step through explicit definition ({cite}`Carnap1931ab` pp. 104-105, {cite}`Benacerraf1983aa` p. 52).\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier Carnap stated the logicist view as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. The *concepts* of mathematics can be derived from logical concepts through explicit definitions. [\\P] 2. The *theorems* of mathematics can be derived from logical axioms through purely logical deduction. ({cite}`Carnap1931ab`pp. 91-92, {cite}`Benacerraf1983aa` p. 41).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the problem that Gödel saw with this: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Therefore the simplest version of the view in question would consist in the assertion that mathematical propositions are true solely owing to the definitions of the terms occurring in them, that is, that by successively replacing all terms by their definietia, any theorem can be reduced to an explicit tautology $a=a$. [... But this] would immediately yield a mechanical procedure for deciding the truth or falsehood of every mathematical proposition. Such a procedure, however, cannot exist, not even for number theory ({cite}`Godel1995-bg` p. 317).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, Gödel is imagining a version of Carnap's 1-2 on which every true proposition of mathematics gets reduced to some specific tautology like $a=a$. Then presumably every false proposition of mathematics would get reduced to some specific contradiction like $a\\neq a$. If this were true, then G\\\"odel is just noting that there would be a computable deductively complete extension of $PA$, since the procedure would just be: do the reduction and figure out whether you reduced to $a=a$ or $a\\neq a$, and in the former case put it in the extension and in the second case don't put it in the extension. \n",
    "\n",
    "G\\\"odel also suggests that versions of Carnap's program could fall afoul of the Second Incompleteness Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Namely, it follows by the metatheorems mentioned that a proof for the tautological character is at the same time a proof for their consistency, and cannot be achieved with any \\emph{weaker} means of proof than are contained in the axioms themselves ({cite}`Godel1995-bg` p. 317).\n",
    "\n",
    "The thought here seems to be that if one succeeded in proving, in $PA$, that every axiom of $PA$ was equivalent in some sense to a tautology, then this would be a proof, in $PA$, that $PA$ was consistent since $0=1$ cannot be derived from a collection of tautologies.\n"
