    "## Proof and program verification\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the original aims of logic, as it developed in the late 19th and early 20th century, was to provide a way to argue rigorously about mathematics and the kinds of set theory or type theory that it seems to necessarily involve. The chief means of achieving this was to develop deductive systems very much like what one learns in introductory logic, and to train people in them. At the end of this training, the ideal outcome was to be able to do proofs effortlessly and without really thinking about the deductive system too much, just like one reads words on the page effortlessly and without really thinking about the underlying phonetics too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two problems with this. First, the deductive system from elementary logic do not have any set theory (or type theory) built into it, and so one has to learn this separately and undergo a kind of second training (if one's goal is proofs in mathematics). Second, this kind of rigor does not help with the kind of error that we tend to be worried about in mathematics today. Today the worry tends to be mathematical proofs are so big and the product of so many hands and so many generations, that error will creep in not by a lapse in rigor by one individual hand as by miscommunications and mismatches in the hand-off of one mathematician to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, people have been interested in tools for the mechanical verification of proofs. It needs to be like proof-checkers for elementary logic classes, but it needs to have some set theory or type-theory built in. And it needs to be responsive to the social nature of mathematics: I need to be able to take your proof and apply it to my setting, ideally without having to recapitulate the proof line by line for my specific purpose. Of course, in traditional mathematics, I just believe your proof or I check it myself, but if we want to mechanically verify then we need to do something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many important proof verification systems, like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) and [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) and [Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.3/getting-started/what-is-agda.html), are built on extensions of the simply typed lambda calculus, extensions which go beyond the implicational fragment. They have the type theory built-in, which handles the need for some set theory or type theory. And since they are built on intimations of BHK, the proofs come with a built-in way to \"apply it\" to any setting. E.g. if you prove $p\\rightarrow q$, then your proof-term is a way to go from any proof of $p$ to a proof of $q$. And then I can just apply that proof-term to my proof of $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These systems are built on intuitionsitic logic rather than classical logic. We have suggested that $p\\rightarrow q$ is to be thought of as all the functions which take you from proofs of $p$ to proof of $q$. And it is not too hard to see that $p\\wedge q$ is going to consist of pairs of proofs, one of $p$ and one of $q$. And $p\\vee q$ is going to consist of proofs of either $p$ or $q$ along with a specification of which. And $\\bot$ is going to be the empty set or some uninstantiated type. But then it is not obvious that $p\\vee (p\\rightarrow \\bot)$ should consist of all the proofs: after all, there are going to be proofs that aren't proofs of $p$ and aren't refutations of $p$. Hence, in short, these approaches are all intuitionistic since on all the obvious interpretations of the propositional connectives as set-like entities, it's not clear that $p\\vee (p\\rightarrow \\bot)$ is going to have the same status as tautology for which most anything will count as a proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final reason that these proof assistants are being developed nowadays is, as suggested by our above discussion of Rice's theorem, $M:P$ can be interpreted both as \"M is a proof of P\", as well as \"M is a program that accomplishes P.\" While we can't say more about the theory of computation in this course, this should not be too surprising, given all the BHK-like talk of constructions we had today. Hence, in a word, these systems are simultaneously ways of verifying that programs, in a certain functional programming language, do what they say they are going to do."
