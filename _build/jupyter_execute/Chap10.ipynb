    "## A semantics for algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "We're looking towards the denotational semantics for programming languages with an eye towards two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intensionality**: How can one construct a traditional semantics for *intensional* notions like procedures? The sense of *intensional* is the opposite of the *extensional* from Rice's theorem, namely, dealing only with input-output behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Partiality**: How can one construct a traditional semantics for *partial* notions like procedures? The sense of *partial* is just *not total*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these brings with it a certain challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Challenge for intensionality*: the traditional intensional approach to semantics goes through modal logic and possible worlds. But since in computation we are dealing with numbers and strings which are the same in every world and every situation, ostensibly modal logic does not apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Challenge for partiality*: Traditional semantics are compositional: the denotation of the whole is a mathematical function of the denotation of the parts. If partiality was implemented in terms of certain denotations not being totally defined, then there is going to be widespread denotation failure: any partiality embedded deep in a relative clause or subroutine may make the entire denotation be partial. However, one might have wanted a way to succeed in assigning denotations to expressions featuring partiality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The possibility of a traditional semantics for procedures matters for philosophy of computation for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Procedural language is not fundamentally different than other parts of language*. Occasionally we might take a moment's solace in the thought that it is a category mistake to ask what a Turing machine program denotes. But denotation is one of our primary ways of understanding meaning, and so we should try to take a day and think through what assigning denotations to procedures would look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Traditionally semantics has been used by philosophers as a lens through which to approach questions of realism.* If one wants to ask whether there are $F$'s, one strand in the analytic tradition suggests focusing in on whether our $F$-words denote and if so what they denote, or what they would have to denote in order for the sentences we accept about $F$'s to come out true. If one wants to ask whether $\\varphi$ is true, one strand in the analytic tradition suggests that this comes down to how $\\varphi$ is put together as a piece of language and what its primitive components pick out or denote. Hence if a denotational semantics for procedures was really unavailable, it would suggest that realism about procedures was also in doubt, or that the determinacy of truth value of statements involving procedures was in doubt.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The denotational semantics are due to Scott-Strachey {cite}`Scott1971-jz`, {cite}`Scott1993-bw` (the latter was written in 1969); another important early paper was {cite}`Plotkin1977-pm`.\n",
