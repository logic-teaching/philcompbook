    "We turn to Turing's 1937 notion of computation ({cite}`Turing1937-ep`), which is the received 'model' of computation still used today. In general, the idea is: a Turing machine program is a set of instructions for the bounded and local action of an idealized agent. The actions are limited to reading and writing symbols, and the actions are defined in terms of an agent's internal states. The computation of the machine is then the deterministic compliance with the instructions in response to a single piece of external stimuli."
