    "First, [the associativity conventions](https://logic-teaching.github.io/philcompbook/Chap05.html#associativity-conventions) dictate that $PQR$ and $OP(QR)$ are abbreviations for terms with at one extra pair of parentheses. Indicate what these terms are.\n",

    "Second, give an intuitive example where $PQR$ means something different than $P(QR)$. Your answer can just be a full English sentence with three intuitive functions $P,Q,R$ which you can describe in prose (usually intuitive functions are implicitly typed, but just set that aside for the moment). \n",
