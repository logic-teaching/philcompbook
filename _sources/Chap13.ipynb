We discuss functionalism in the philosophy of mind, which takes the Turing machine as its inspiratation or model, and we discuss the computational theory of mind, which on one telling is understood to look to computation as a component of the best kinds of psychological explanations."

    "## Functionalism \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of functionalism\n",
    "\n",
    "Mental states are identified with the functional role that they play in (i) being caused by certain sensory stimuli, certain bodily actions, and certain other mental states, and (ii) causing certain bodily actions and certain other mental states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: pain is just whatever is both (a) caused by pinches, pressures, heat and certain chemicals, and (b) causes characteristic verbal expressions like \"ouch\" and mental states such as sadness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implemenation and realization\n",
    "\n",
    "The functional role is necessarily paired with a notion of implementation or realization. For instance, C-fiber firing biologically implements pain in humans. It is explicitly left open that there could be different biological implementations of one and the same mental state. E.g. if an alien’s mental state was appropriately related to pinches, and yelps, there is an intuition that it should be called pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putnam\n",
    "\n",
    "Putnam in his \"Minds and machines\" took as his model the Turing machine: \n",
    "\n",
    "> The analogy which has been presented between logical states of a Turing machine and mental states of a human being, on the one hand, and structural states of a Turing machine and physical states of a human being, on the other, is one that I find very suggestive ({cite}`Putnam1979-cb` p. 373; paper originally published in 1960)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges to functionalism \n",
    "\n",
    "A traditional challenge is qualia. There is something felt sense in which experiencing the vivid bite of fresh pineapple cannot be reducing to what it is caused by and what it causes. You might even be able to imagine someone who is outfitted causally just like us but who is missing these experiences: it is a problem for functionalism if what they are missing is a mental state.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other challenges. But functionalism is something like a dominant framework in contemporary philosophy of mind, or at least a position around which most everyone has to orientate themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computational theory of mind \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pylyshyn\n",
    "\n",
    "Pylyshyn from his 1980 \"Computation and cognition\":\n",
    "\n",
    "> What I wish to focus on here is what I take to be the most fundamental reason why cognition ought to be viewed as computation. That reason rests on the fact that computation is the only worked-out view of process that is both compatible with a materialist view of how a process is realized and that attributes the behavior of the process to the operation of rules upon representations. ({cite}`Pylyshyn1980-ab` p. 113).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different gradations of the position\n",
    "\n",
    "There are gradations of the position depending on what force one wants to give to the \"ought to be viewed\":\n",
    "-\tMere methodological rule of thumb: be concerned with the rules by which cognition operates and the representations on which it operates. \n",
    "-\tHypothesis about the nature of mentality: cognitive processes just are procedural operations on representations. \n",
    "-\tThe nature of explanations in psychology: the best explanations of cognitive skills and achievements goes by way of an identification of cognitive procedures on representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relation between computational theory of mind and functionalism\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational theory of mind is often paired with functionalism, but there is not a strict entailment one way or the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionalism without computational theory of mind\n",
    "\n",
    "Apriori, one could be a functionalist but deny that the relevant causal processes can be usefully understood as algorithmic:\n",
    "-\tmaybe they are stochastic or probabilistic in a way that is not amenable to the most obvious algorithmic approaches,\n",
    "-\tmaybe they do not issue in or operate on representations in any easily understood way\n",
    "-\tmaybe one has some reason to think that they do not necessarily even result in computable procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational theory of mind without functionalism\n",
    "\n",
    "One could adhere to the computational theory of mind but not feel that one can sign onto all of functionalism:\n",
    "-\tJust as one could apriori think that there is something important and distinctive about programs implemented on certain hardware, so one might hold the same about cognitive processes implemented in human brains and bodies.\n",
    "-\tOne may think that that evidence tells us that there’s something that plays a certain functional role but we are not in a position to say what the realizer is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to combine the two positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Edelman presents, in chapter 2, a useful way of combining computational theory of mind and functionalism:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I propose to explain the nature of minds in terms of the function of brains, brain function in terms of computation, and computation itself in terms of principled manipulation of representations ({cite}`Edelman2008-fa` p. 13).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Minds are what brains do. [$\\rightarrow$] Brains embody varieties of computation. [$\\rightarrow$] Computation is formally constrained manipulation of representations\" ({cite}`Edelman2008-fa` p. 14).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very worked out example using neural networks from {cite}`Edelman2008-fa` pp. 56-57:\n",
    "\n",
    "> over successive iterations, the direction of the weight vector converges to coincide  with the direction of the main elongation of the cloud of inputs ({cite}`Edelman2008-fa` p. 57).\n",
    "\n",
    "> What, then can a single neuron compute? As you have just discovered, the answer to this question is this: low-dimensional statistics of its input distribution\" ({cite}`Edelman2008-fa` p. 57)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems with computational theory of mind\n",
    "\n",
    "To the extent that it is wedded with functionalism, it will inherit these problems. A distinct problem is the so-called triviality argument (cf. {cite}`Sprevak2018-fm`), which purports to show that it is easy to for any physical organism to implement certain kinds of Turing machine. The general template is: \n",
    "\n",
    "- take any physical organism which changes over time\n",
    "- take time-slices to be states \n",
    "- view it as a Turing machine acting on an empty input and only moving to the left and shifting state as time moves on\n",
    "- if you need more states, make more time-slices\n",
    "\n",
    "This class of Turing machines corresponds to the deterministic finite automata, which still includes a lot. It computes the regular languages (i.e. regular sets of strings). See 'regular' on [the map](img/map-handout.pdf) (it is the tiny part at the bottom of the map on the right-hand side).\n",
    "\n",
    "An initial reaction to triviality arguments is that it works with \"unnatural\" notions of states. But this will be difficult for an advocate of both functionalism and computational theory of mind to pursue: she wants to tell us that brains implement Turing machines and that the mentality is captured thereby, but would be equally well captured by other implementations of Turing machines.
